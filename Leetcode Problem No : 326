# 🪙 Coin Change Problem (Leetcode #322)

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Given an array of coins `coins[]` of different denominations and an integer `amount`, return the **fewest number of coins** that make up that amount. If it is **not possible** to make the amount, return `-1`.  

### 🔹 Example 1:  
```python
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11  
Output: 3  
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1  
```

### 🔹 Example 2:  
```python
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3  
Output: -1  
Explanation: No valid combination  
```

## 🚀 Solution Approach  
This problem can be solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with a **bottom-up approach**.  
- We create a **dp array** where `dp[i]` represents the **minimum number of coins** required to make `i`.  
- Initialize `dp[i]` with `float('inf')`, meaning we assume it's impossible to form that amount initially.  
- The base case is `dp[0] = 0` (0 coins needed to make amount 0).  
- Iterate over each amount `i` and check every coin to see if it can contribute to the minimum count.

## 📝 Optimized Python Solution  

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed for amount 0

        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if i >= c and dp[i - c] != float('inf'):
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)

        return -1 if dp[amount] == float('inf') else dp[amount]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.coinChange([1, 2, 5], 11))  # Output: 3 (5+5+1)
```

## ⏳ Time & Space Complexity  
✅ **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)` (where `n = amount`, `m = number of coins`)  
✅ **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (storing `dp` array)
