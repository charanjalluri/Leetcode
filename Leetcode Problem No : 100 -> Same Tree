# 🌳 Same Tree (LeetCode #100)

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are **the same**.  
Two trees are the same if they have the same structure and the same node values.

### 🔹 Example 1:
```python
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]  
Output: True
```
```
    1       1
   / \     / \
  2   3   2   3
```
Both trees are identical.

### 🔹 Example 2:
```python
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]  
Output: False
```
```
    1       1
   /         \
  2           2
```
The structures are different, so the trees are not the same.

## 🚀 Solution Approach  

### 1️⃣ **Recursive Approach (DFS)**
   - If both trees are `None`, return `True`.
   - If only one tree is `None`, return `False`.
   - Compare the values of `p` and `q`, then check their left and right subtrees recursively.

### 2️⃣ **Iterative Approach (BFS)**
   - Use a **queue** to traverse both trees at the same time.
   - Compare values at each level.

## 📝 Python Solution (Recursive - DFS)
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        """
        Checks if two binary trees are identical using DFS.
        :param p: TreeNode (root of first tree)
        :param q: TreeNode (root of second tree)
        :return: bool (True if same, False otherwise)
        """
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```

```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis  
✅ **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` (Visit all nodes once)  
✅ **Space Complexity:**  
   - **DFS Recursive:** `O(N)` (Recursion stack in worst case)  
   - **BFS Iterative:** `O(N)` (Queue for level-order traversal)
